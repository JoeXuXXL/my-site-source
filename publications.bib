  abstract={In this paper, we report an interesting kinematic phenomenon around the halos' edge related to the splashback radius. After the shell-crossing, cosmic flow exhibits various rotational morphologies via stream-mixing. Vorticity is generated in a particular way that coincides with the large-scale structure. Notably, one specific flow morphology, which is spiraling inward and compressing in the third direction, concentrates around halos. A detailed examination that reveals a sharp change in the logarithmic derivative of its volume fraction, coincides with the location of the splashback radius defined as the outermost caustic structure. Such a feature encodes valuable phase space information and provides a new perspective on understanding the dynamical evolution of halos. As a volume-weighted quantity, the profile of flow morphology is purely kinematic. And unlike other related studies, the rotational flow morphologies capture the anisotropic phase structure in the multi-stream region.}

  abstract={In this thesis, we explore the applications of the theory of operator algebras, such as C ∗ -algebras and von Neumann algebras, in quantum physics with a focus on the quantum bilocal network scenario. Originating from Heisenberg’s picture, the theory of operator algebras has become a fruitful field and a powerful mathematical tool in the study of quantum systems. Quantum nonlocality is essential for understanding the foundations of quantum mechanics, and quantum correlations in network scenarios provide a robust framework for its investigation.

We combine the algebraic perspective with the study of quantum nonlocality to analyse the quantum bilocal network scenario, involving three parties, Alice, Bob, and Charlie, arranged linearly. In this scenario, two independent quantum sources are present, one shared between Alice and Bob, and the other shared between Bob and Charlie. Recent developments from [57, Renou & Xu, arXiv:2210.09065] and [35, Ligthart & Gross, arXiv:2212.11299] demonstrate the applicability of operator algebras in this context, offering a deeper understanding of quantum nonlocality in network settings.

This thesis serves as a reference for results in the theory of operator algebras relevant to the study of quantum nonlocality, introducing notable results and attempting to draw connections between them. By building upon the findings of the two papers mentioned above, the thesis highlights the potential of these abstract mathematical tools in uncovering new insights into quantum mechanics and motivates further research in the field using an operator algebraic perspective.}

      abstract={Characterising the correlations that arise from locally measuring a single part of a joint quantum system is one of the main problems of quantum information theory. The seminal work [M. Navascués et al, NJP 10,7,073013 (2008)], known as the NPA hierarchy, reformulated this question as a polynomial optimisation problem over noncommutative variables and proposed a convergent hierarchy of necessary conditions, each testable using semidefinite programming. More recently, the problem of characterising the quantum network correlations, which arise when locally measuring several independent quantum systems distributed in a network, has received considerable interest. Several generalisations of the NPA hierarchy, such as the Scalar Extension [Pozas-Kerstjens et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 140503 (2019)], were introduced while their converging sets remain unknown. In this work, we introduce a new hierarchy, prove its equivalence to the Scalar Extension, and characterise its convergence in the case of the simplest network, the bilocal scenario, and explore its relations with the known generalisations.}

      abstract={Whether an almost-commuting pair of operators must be close to a commuting pair is a central question in operator and matrix theory. We investigate this problem for pairs of $C^*$-subalgebras $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ of $M_d(\mathbb{C})$, showing that each operator in $\mathcal{B}$ is $O(d^2\epsilon)$-close in operator norm to an operator in the commutant $\mathcal{A}'$ under two complementary formulations of ``$\epsilon$-almost commutation.'' One formulation is probabilistic, requiring that the operators of $\\mathcal{B}$ have small commutators for most Haar-random unitaries acting on $\mathcal{A}$. This first formulation leads to two novel probabilistic generalizations of Stampfli's theorem, which relates an operator's distance from the scalars to the norm of its inner derivation. The second formulation is deterministic, requiring small commutators between the generators of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$; we analyze this using an approximate Schur's lemma formulated in terms of Weyl-Heisenberg (clock-and-shift) matrices. As an application of our results to quantum information theory, we obtain a quantitative Tsirelson's theorem: in dimension $d$, every $\epsilon$-almost quantum commuting observable model is well approximated by a quantum tensor-product model with error $O(d^2\epsilon)$.}

      abstract={Compiling Bell games under cryptographic assumptions replaces the need for physical separation, allowing nonlocality to be probed with a single untrusted device. While Kalai et al. (STOC'23) showed that this compilation preserves quantum advantages, its quantitative quantum soundness has remained an open problem. We address this gap with two primary contributions. First, we establish the \emph{first} quantitative quantum soundness bounds for every bipartite compiled Bell game whose optimal quantum strategy is finite-dimensional: any polynomial-time prover's score in the compiled game is negligibly close to the game's ideal quantum value. More generally, for all bipartite games we show that the compiled score cannot significantly exceed the bounds given by a newly formalized convergent \emph{sequential Navascués-Pironio-Acín (NPA) hierarchy}. Second, we provide a full characterization of this sequential NPA hierarchy, establishing it as a robust numerical tool that is of independent interest. Finally, for games without finite-dimensional optimal strategies, we explore the necessity of NPA approximation error for quantitatively bounding their compiled scores, linking these considerations to the complexity conjecture $\mathrm{MIP}^{\mathrm{co}}=\mathrm{coRE}$ and open challenges such as quantum homomorphic encryption correctness for ``weakly commuting'' quantum registers.}

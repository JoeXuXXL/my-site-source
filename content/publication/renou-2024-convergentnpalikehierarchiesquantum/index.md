abstract: Characterising the correlations that arise from locally measuring a single
  part of a joint quantum system is one of the main problems of quantum information
  theory. The seminal work [M. Navascu√©s et al, NJP 10,7,073013 (2008)], known as
  the NPA hierarchy, reformulated this question as a polynomial optimisation problem
  over noncommutative variables and proposed a convergent hierarchy of necessary conditions,
  each testable using semidefinite programming. More recently, the problem of characterising
  the quantum network correlations, which arise when locally measuring several independent
  quantum systems distributed in a network, has received considerable interest. Several
  generalisations of the NPA hierarchy, such as the Scalar Extension [Pozas-Kerstjens
  et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 140503 (2019)], were introduced while their converging
  sets remain unknown. In this work, we introduce a new hierarchy, prove its equivalence
  to the Scalar Extension, and characterise its convergence in the case of the simplest
  network, the bilocal scenario, and explore its relations with the known generalisations.

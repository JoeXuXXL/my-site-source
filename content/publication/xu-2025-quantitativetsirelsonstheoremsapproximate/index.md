  Whether an almost-commuting pair of operators must be close to a commuting
  pair is a central question in operator and matrix theory. We investigate this problem
  for pairs of $C^*$-subalgebras $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ of $M_d(\mathbb{C})$, showing that
  each operator in $\mathcal{B}$ is $O(d^2\varepsilon)$-close in operator norm to an operator in
  the commutant $\mathcal{A}'$ under two complementary formulations of ``$\varepsilon$-almost commutation.''
  One formulation is probabilistic, requiring that the operators of $\mathcal{B}$ have
  small commutators for most Haar-random unitaries acting on $\mathcal{A}$. This first
  formulation leads to two novel probabilistic generalizations of Stampfli's theorem,
  which relates an operator's distance from the scalars to the norm of its inner derivation.
  The second formulation is deterministic, requiring small commutators between the
  generators of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$; we analyze this using an approximate Schur's
  lemma formulated in terms of Weyl-Heisenberg (clock-and-shift) matrices. As an application
  of our results to quantum information theory, we obtain a quantitative Tsirelson's
  theorem: in dimension $d$, every $\varepsilon$-almost quantum commuting observable model is
  well approximated by a quantum tensor-product model with error $O(d^2\varepsilon)$.

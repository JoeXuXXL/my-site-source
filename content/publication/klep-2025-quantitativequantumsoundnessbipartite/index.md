abstract: "Compiling Bell games under cryptographic assumptions replaces the need
  for physical separation, allowing nonlocality to be probed with a single untrusted
  device. While Kalai et al. (STOC'23) showed that this compilation preserves quantum
  advantages, its quantitative quantum soundness has remained an open problem. We
  address this gap with two primary contributions. First, we establish the emphfirst
  quantitative quantum soundness bounds for every bipartite compiled Bell game whose
  optimal quantum strategy is finite-dimensional: any polynomial-time prover's score
  in the compiled game is negligibly close to the game's ideal quantum value. More
  generally, for all bipartite games we show that the compiled score cannot significantly
  exceed the bounds given by a newly formalized convergent emphsequential Navascués-Pironio-Acín
  (NPA) hierarchy. Second, we provide a full characterization of this sequential NPA
  hierarchy, establishing it as a robust numerical tool that is of independent interest.
  Finally, for games without finite-dimensional optimal strategies, we explore the
  necessity of NPA approximation error for quantitatively bounding their compiled
  scores, linking these considerations to the complexity conjecture $mathrmMIP^mathrmco=mathrmcoRE$
  and open challenges such as quantum homomorphic encryption correctness for ``weakly
  commuting'' quantum registers."

abstract: In this paper, we report an interesting kinematic phenomenon around the
  halos' edge related to the splashback radius. After the shell-crossing, cosmic flow
  exhibits various rotational morphologies via stream-mixing. Vorticity is generated
  in a particular way that coincides with the large-scale structure. Notably, one
  specific flow morphology, which is spiraling inward and compressing in the third
  direction, concentrates around halos. A detailed examination that reveals a sharp
  change in the logarithmic derivative of its volume fraction, coincides with the
  location of the splashback radius defined as the outermost caustic structure. Such
  a feature encodes valuable phase space information and provides a new perspective
  on understanding the dynamical evolution of halos. As a volume-weighted quantity,
  the profile of flow morphology is purely kinematic. And unlike other related studies,
  the rotational flow morphologies capture the anisotropic phase structure in the
  multi-stream region.

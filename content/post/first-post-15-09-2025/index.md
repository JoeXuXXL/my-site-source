As an "entertainment" to amuses myself after two weeks of continuously working, for two submissions of QIP, I decided to make a website through GitHub.

My programming skill is long gone for at least five years. Took me a long time trying to figure out this Hugo + GitHub mess. But once it is sorted out, it is sorted out, phew. Rather late in the night now.

愿功夫不负有心人吧。

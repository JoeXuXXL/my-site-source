  #     text: |-
  #       I am a mathematical physicist in quantum information theory and quantum foundations. 

  #       I am interested in understanding quantum network correlations, many-body physics, and cryptography, by applying tools including the theory of operator algebras and noncommutative polynomial optimization. I joined the team PhiQus at Inria Paris-Saclay as a PhD student since October 2023.
